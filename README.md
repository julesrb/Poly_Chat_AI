# Poly Chat AI

## 🌟 Inspiration  
Poly Chat AI was born out of daily frustrations when using ChatGPT for personal tasks:  
- The **inability to go backward** in a conversation.  
- Important insights getting **lost in a sea of message history**.  
- A blur of conversations without clear organization.  
- The **confusion of not knowing which model to use** in different contexts.  

The primary idea here is to build a chat system with a **UI and functions that allow better navigation and organization**. A tool where conversations can be guided, revisited, and structured — so that important information is never lost.

## 🎯 Project Goal  
This project serves primarily as a **learning exercise**, with a strong focus on **interface and usability**.  
The goals include:  
- Implementing chat functionality with LLMs.  
- Designing a **centralized chat web app** where specialized models can be accessed without switching platforms.  
- Providing **conversation navigation** that makes it easy to revisit past discussions.  
- Building a foundation for a more intuitive, personal AI companion.

## ⚠️ Status: Work in Progress  
Poly Chat AI is under active development. Features, design, and structure are subject to change as the project evolves.
